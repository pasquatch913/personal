# Personal

Built using Jekyll and a resume template. Site is built using the /docs directory.

## Local Development

Build the site by running `bundle install` in the /docs directory.
Run the site locally by running `bundle exec jekyll serve`. Updates to file content will be updated on the locally running site after saving the file and refreshing the page. Updates to site structure require a rebuild of the project.
